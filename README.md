# 📊 Startup Funding Analysis

Welcome to the **Startup Funding Analysis** project! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of startup funding patterns in India, leveraging data visualization techniques to uncover insights about investment trends, top investors, funding stages, and more. The analysis is built using **Streamlit** and **Plotly**, making it interactive and user-friendly.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is designed to help users understand various aspects of startup funding in India, including:

- **Funding Amounts by Month/Year**: Visualizing the total and count of funding amounts over time.
- **Funding Types**: Analyzing the different types of funding (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series B).
- **City-wise Funding**: Understanding which cities attract the most funding.
- **Top Startups and Investors**: Identifying the top-funded startups and most active investors.
- **Sector Analysis**: Breaking down funding by sector to see which industries are attracting the most investment.
- **Interactive Heatmaps**: Visualizing funding distribution across different months and years.
- **Investor-Specific Insights**: Drilling down into specific investors to see their biggest investments, sectors of interest, and year-on-year funding trends.
- **Similar Companies**: Displaying startups that are similar in terms of industry or investment.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

Before diving into the visualizations, we performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** on the dataset. This process included:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Handling missing values.
- Extracting key features like funding type, city, and investor information.
- Creating new features for enhanced analysis.

## 📈 Visualizations

The project utilizes **Plotly** for dynamic and interactive visualizations, providing a more engaging experience for users. Some of the key visualizations include:

- **Line Charts**: For month-on-month and year-on-year analysis of funding amounts.
- **Bar Charts**: For city-wise funding distribution and top startups/investors.
- **Pie Charts**: For sector-wise investment breakdown and funding stage analysis.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize funding intensity over time.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using **Streamlit**, making the analysis easy to use and navigate.
